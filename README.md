The problem:
You, the trigger-happy photographer, have over the years accumulated digital pictures running into tens of thousands. A good number of those are duplicates - mainly because you imported them from your camera multiple times or just created copies in different folders. Either way you want to get rid of duplicates.

The solution:
photobroom includes a set of tools to identify and delete duplicate photos. Actually, the tools just build a batch file (Windows) or a shell script (Linux). You have to manually run the script which then move the duplicate to a temporary directory which you can delete after you've had a chance to inspect the contents.
